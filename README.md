#Memory game explanation

Memory games are logic games that are used to train memory and attention. I wanted to create a simple memory game that can help users test their visual memory. The general outline of the game is that there are 2 pictures that are shown for 3 seconds and after each image, users answer questions based on their memory. 

Background 

As I learned more about UX Design, I wanted to learn more about front end technologies and since I already knew Java, I knew that Kotlin was the best choice to learn and create my first Android app. 


#Planning 

Before starting to code, I first needed to figure out how the game would work. Since I wanted to create a game that tests visual memory, I brainstormed a couple ideas and ended up a simple plan shown below.  After creating the game plan, I started planning out the UI of the app. I used Adobe XD to organize different screens and their interactions. 

#Execution

After designing and organizing the screens, I started coding in Kotlin on android studio and began creating my app. 

Important features
I used handler to pause the image on the screen for a couple seconds before automatically switching to the next activity. 

I created a splash screen to generate immediate visual interest and keep users interested in the app.
